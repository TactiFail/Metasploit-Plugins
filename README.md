# Metasploit-Plugins

A collection of Metasploit plugins I have written for various reasons. To use, simply download the plugin of your choice into your Metasploit's `plugins` folder (typically `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins/`) and run `load $plugin` e.g. `load stats`.

## Overview

### stats.rb

This plugin simply provides a few commands for displaying stats about the current workspace such as most popular ports, total hosts/services, etc.

```
msf6 > load stats
[*] Successfully loaded plugin: stats
msf6 > count_all
8 total hosts (8 alive)
43 total services (32 open)
msf6 > count_hosts
8 total hosts (8 alive)
msf6 > count_services

msf6 > top_ports
Top 10 open ports:

### powersploit_portscan_db_import.rb

This plugin provides the `powersploit_portscan_db_import <filename.xml>` command to import host and service info from XML files generated by the [PowerSploit Invoke-Portscan utility](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit#invoke-portscan). This is useful in cases where you are on a Windows machine and cannot run `nmap` due to an EDR, for example. By default this plugin will only import hosts which are up, and ports which are open. There are comments in the source for how to change this do import all hosts and ports (down hosts and closed/filtered ports alike) if desired.
